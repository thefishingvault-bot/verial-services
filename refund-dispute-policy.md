# REFUND & DISPUTE POLICY

Verial Services Ltd

**Last Updated:** January 2026

This Refund & Dispute Policy applies to all bookings made through the Verial platform.

It is designed to be clear and consistent across the Platform. Where some steps are not yet automated, they are handled by Verial administrators (see section 6).

## 1. Key definitions

- **Booking start time**: the scheduled start time shown for a booking.
- **Completion**: the point at which a booking is treated as completed in the Platform.
- **Provider fault**: includes (at a minimum) provider no-show, late provider cancellation, or failure to deliver the booked service.

## 2. Cancellation rules (locked policy)

### 2.1 Free cancellation (up to 24 hours)

Cancellations are free up to **24 hours before the Booking start time**.

### 2.2 Late cancellations (within 24 hours)

Cancellations made within **24 hours of the Booking start time** are **non-refundable**, unless the cancellation is due to **Provider fault**.

## 3. No-shows (locked policy)

- **Customer no-show:** no refund.
- **Provider no-show:** full refund (excluding non-refundable Stripe fees).

## 4. Stripe fees (locked policy)

- Stripe processing fees are **non-refundable**.
- The Platform does **not** absorb Stripe processing fees.

If a refund is approved, the refunded amount will exclude Stripe processing fees.

## 5. Disputes (locked policy)

### 5.1 Who can raise a dispute

Both Customers and Providers may initiate disputes.

### 5.2 Dispute window

Disputes must be raised within **7 days of booking completion**.

### 5.3 Review process

- All disputes are **admin-reviewed**.
- Payouts may be **paused during investigation**.
- Verial does not guarantee any particular outcome.

## 6. How refunds and disputes are processed today (implementation honesty)

Some parts of these rules are not yet fully automated.

At this stage:

- Cancellation eligibility (including the 24-hour window and Provider fault assessment) is reviewed and processed by Verial administrators.
- Disputes are reviewed and processed by Verial administrators.

Verial may request evidence from either party (for example, messages, photos, receipts, and other relevant information).

## 7. Refund timing expectations

Once a refund is approved, Verial submits it to Stripe promptly.

The time for the refunded amount to appear on your statement depends on Stripe and your bank/card issuer.

## 8. Chargebacks

If a Customer initiates a chargeback:

- it is handled through Stripe’s chargeback process;
- Verial may request information from the Customer and Provider;
- payouts may be paused and risk controls may be applied while the chargeback is investigated.
