These Terms apply to your use of the Verial platform (the **Platform**).

## 1. Key points (plain English)

- Verial is a marketplace platform. Verial is **not** the service provider.
- Providers are independent contractors. Providers are **not** Verial employees, agents, or partners.
- Payments flow through Verial via Stripe as the platform intermediary.
- Refunds, cancellations, no-shows, and disputes are governed by Verial’s platform-wide rules in section 6.

## 2. Acceptance

By accessing or using the Platform, you agree to these Terms.
If you do not agree, do not use the Platform.

## 3. Definitions

- **Customer**: a person who books services.
- **Provider**: a person or business that lists and delivers services.
- **Booking**: a confirmed request for a service through the Platform.
- **Booking start time**: the scheduled start time shown for a Booking.
- **Completion**: the point at which the Booking is treated as completed in the Platform.

## 4. Verial’s role (marketplace)

The Platform connects Customers with Providers.

- The contract for the service is between the Customer and the Provider.
- Providers are responsible for delivering the service, including quality and compliance.
- Verial provides the Platform features (listings, booking workflow, payments, and communications) and support processes.

## 5. Accounts and eligibility

You must be 18 years or older to use the Platform.

You agree to:

- provide accurate information (and keep it up to date);
- keep your login credentials secure; and
- be responsible for activity on your account.

Verial uses third-party authentication providers (see our Privacy Policy).

## 6. Payments, refunds, cancellations, no-shows, and disputes

### 6.1 Payments and Stripe

- Payments are processed via Stripe.
- Verial does not store card numbers or full payment card details.
- Verial collects payment from the Customer through Stripe and facilitates payout to the Provider via Stripe Connect.

### 6.2 Platform-wide refunds and cancellations (locked policy)

These rules apply to all Bookings on Verial.

**Free cancellation (Customer or Provider)**

- Free cancellation is available up to **24 hours before the Booking start time**.

**Late cancellation**

- Cancellations made within **24 hours of the Booking start time** are **non-refundable**, unless the cancellation is due to **Provider fault**.

**Provider fault** includes (at a minimum):

- the Provider does not show up for the Booking;
- the Provider cancels late; or
- the Provider fails to deliver the booked service.

**Stripe fees**

- Stripe processing fees are **non-refundable**.
- The Platform does **not** absorb Stripe processing fees.

This means that where a refund is approved, the refunded amount will exclude Stripe processing fees.

### 6.3 No-shows (locked policy)

- **Customer no-show:** no refund.
- **Provider no-show:** full refund (excluding non-refundable Stripe fees).

### 6.4 Disputes (locked policy)

- Both Customers and Providers may initiate a dispute.
- Disputes must be raised within **7 days of Booking completion**.
- All disputes are **admin-reviewed**.
- Payouts may be **paused during an investigation**.
- Verial does not guarantee any particular outcome.

### 6.5 How refunds and disputes are handled today (implementation honesty)

Some parts of the refund/dispute process are not yet fully automated.
At this stage:

- cancellation/refund eligibility (including the 24-hour window and Provider fault assessment) is reviewed and processed by Verial administrators; and
- disputes are reviewed and processed by Verial administrators.

Verial may request information from both parties (for example, messages, photos, receipts, and other evidence) to assess eligibility and outcomes.

### 6.6 Chargebacks

If a Customer initiates a chargeback through their bank/card provider:

- the chargeback will be handled through Stripe’s chargeback process;
- Verial may request information from the Customer and Provider;
- Verial may pause payouts and/or take account risk actions while the chargeback is investigated.

## 7. Provider obligations (including taxes)

Providers must:

- accurately describe services, pricing, and availability;
- deliver services with reasonable care and skill; and
- comply with all applicable New Zealand laws.

Providers are responsible for their own taxes, including GST if applicable.

## 8. Platform controls, verification, and risk

To protect users and the Platform, Verial may:

- require verification for Providers (including identity verification);
- suspend or restrict accounts or listings;
- pause payouts where required for disputes, fraud prevention, or compliance checks;
- refuse or reverse transactions where required by law or Stripe rules.

Users retain ownership of their content, but grant Verial a licence to host, display, and process it for Platform operation.

## 11. Liability and consumer law

To the maximum extent permitted by law:
